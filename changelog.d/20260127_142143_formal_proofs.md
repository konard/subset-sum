### Added
- Formal mathematical proofs in Lean 4 and Rocq (Coq) that establish the equivalence between a finite set and an ordered sequence with unique elements (sorted, deduplicated list)
- CI/CD workflows for automatic verification of Lean 4 and Rocq proofs
- Proofs demonstrate that subset sum transformations preserve mathematical correctness

### Changed
- Updated CONJECTURES.md with "Formally Verified Statements" section linking to the proof files
